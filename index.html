       <p>Hello, my name is Selam Mengisteab, and I am a Financial Relationships Consultant at US Bank in Roosevelt, WA. 
         With 5 years of experience in banking and tellering. 
         I specialized in offering retail banking products and services such including opening accounts, loans, credit cards and basic client Interactions and Engagement. 
         While working in the bank industry, I learned to Empower the growth and development of branch staff to encourage proficiency and effectiveness through leveraging banking processes. 
         This allowed for me to gain excellent skills and abilities to be able to work with people, and be able to deliver financial planning solutions for my clients. Working with this industry really pushed my proficiency and accomplishment in customer service alone with reaching customer banking and investment goals.
      </p>
       
       
       <p>Something I am passionate about outside my work life is volunteering at non-profit organizations. 
         I am an ambassador for Goodwill, hence I thrive and enjoy attending events and building connections with people with every potentiality. 
         Doing this, I have become very good at my communication and interaction skills, as I am constantly engaging with different clients and customers.</p>

       <p>Currently I am a Year-Up student expanding on my portfolio and connections to a professional level, as well as find success through education as an inspiring Software Developer. 
         I am working to enhance my skill set when it comes to being knowledgeable and having expertise in the IT field. 
         I will work hard to measure my goal by making sure i research and learn more about coding, business communication and connecting with people who have already branded themselves and have found success in their career.
         By the end of this journey, my goal is to grow and develop as a professional, by creating and building new leadership skills and competence for a successful career.</p>
